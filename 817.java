/*
We are given head, the head node of a linked list containing unique integer values.

We are also given the list G, a subset of the values in the linked list.

Return the number of connected components in G, where two values are connected if they appear consecutively in the linked list.

Example 1:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3
G = [0, 1, 3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3] are the two connected components.
Example 2:

Input: 
head: 0->1->2->3->4
G = [0, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
0 and 1 are connected, 3 and 4 are connected, so [0, 1] and [3, 4] are the two connected components.
