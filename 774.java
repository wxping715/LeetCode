On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions stations[0], stations[1], ..., stations[N-1], where N = stations.length.

Now, we add K more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent gas stations, is minimized.

Return the smallest possible value of D.

Example:

Input: stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], K = 9
Output: 0.500000
Note:

stations.length will be an integer in range [10, 2000].
stations[i] will be an integer in range [0, 10^8].
K will be an integer in range [1, 10^6].
Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.

class Solution {
    public double minmaxGasDist(int[] stations, int K) {
        int count = 0, N = stations.length;
        double left = 0, right = stations[N - 1] - stations[0], mid;

        while (left +1e-6 < right) {
            mid = (left + right) / 2;
            count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < N - 1; ++i)
                count += Math.ceil((stations[i + 1] - stations[i]) / mid) - 1;
            if (count > K) left = mid;
            else right = mid;
        }
        return right;
    }
}
